# Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
# Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
# Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
# The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1

#
# nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0]
# m = 3
#
# nums2 = [2,5,6]
# n = 3
# nums1 = nums1[:m]
# for i in range(0,n):
#     nums1.append(nums2[i])
# print(sorted(nums1))
